## Photography Portfolio Website

A professional photography portfolio website showcasing my work, built with Next.js and utilising various technologies such as Framer Motion, Leaflet, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

### Overview

This project is a personal photography portfolio web application developed using Next.js to enhance the user experience and functionality.

### Features

- Engaging landing page with a compelling statement.
- Showcasing a diverse collection of photographs from various categories including Travel, Gigs, and Festivals.
- Interactive map feature displaying photos based on their geolocation using Geo JSON.
- Contact form powered by WEB3 technology for seamless communication.

### To-Dos

- Fix env variables.
- Improve animation and fade-in effects to ensure smooth and polished transitions.
- Implement routing functionality to enable seamless navigation throughout the website.
- Allocate space within the Map component to share the intriguing stories behind each image.
- Set up database to store and manage user comments.
- Develop comment functionality that allows users to express their thoughts using emoji reactions. For longer comments, encourage users to utilize the contact form, enabling a curated response.


#### If you want to clone this app and run it locally:

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

<!-- You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
