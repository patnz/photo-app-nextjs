## Next.js Photo App Project

First time building a Next.js app, coming from having learned React.

### Notes

</>

### Progress / TODO

I've built the landing page and encorporated some of my photography with a functional WEB3 Form. 

TODO: Fix WEB3 Form to use hidden environment variable.

Fix up animation/fade-ins. They're a bit janky at this point.

TODO: Get routes up and running.

TODO: Build Gallery page for viewing photos. 
> Gallery Page should have space for 'story'.

TODO: Set up database for storing comments? Maybe comments should be limited to emoji reactions and people should be encouraged to use contact form for longer comments, that way I can curate response?

TODO: Set up comment functionality. Maybe comments should be limited to emoji reactions and people should be encouraged to use contact form for longer comments, that way I can curate response?

<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details. -->
